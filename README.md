## Troubleshooting

### Extension doesn't insert text
- Check that the GPT URL and title match are correctly configured
- Ensure ChatGPT page is fully loaded before selecting text
- Try disabling auto-submit and manually clicking send

### Tabs not opening correctly
- Verify the Custom GPT URL is correct in extension options
- Check browser's tab title by hovering over the tab
- Ensure ChatGPT is accessible and you're logged in

### Keyboard shortcuts don't work
- Ensure no other extension is using the same shortcuts
- Configure shortcuts in the extension options page
- After reloading the extension, refresh any open pages to reload the content script
- Some system shortcuts may override extension shortcuts

### "Could not auto-insert text" alert
- ChatGPT may have changed their DOM structure
- Check browser console for detailed error logs
- Consider updating selector patterns in background.js:130-139

## Configuration Best Practices

### For Fast Workflow
- Enable `Auto Submit` for hands-free operation
- Customize keyboard shortcuts to match your muscle memory
- Use "Run All Actions" when you need comprehensive analysis

### Managing Actions
- Disable actions you don't use frequently to keep menus clean
- Reorder actions to put most-used ones at the top
- Export your configuration regularly as backup
